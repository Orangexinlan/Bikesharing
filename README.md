## Summary

- Two additional visualizations:
  1. If the data woud have included the $ cost of reapirs, I would have looked into to see if there is any co-relation between the trip duartion and cost of reapirs. 
  2. Availability of bikes in most demand location, whether clients have to wait or bikes are available easly. 
  
- The far majority of the rides were in the very busy Manhattan Island, taken by male users during morning and evening rush hours. This implies that Citi Bike services are used as an alternative to public transportation by commuting workers.
